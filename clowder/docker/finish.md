# Starting Clowder using Docker

As part of this scenario you have deployed clowder using docker-compose, added a new user as well as an extractor. If you want to add more extractors you can add them to docker-compose.override.yml and run the `docker-compose up -d` command again.

If you have more questions about clowder, check out our [webpage](https://clowderframework.org/) or feel free to drop by in [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/clowder-software/shared_invite/enQtMzQzOTg0Nzk3OTUzLTYwZDlkZDI0NGI4YmI0ZjE5MTZiYmZhZTIyNWE1YzM0NWMwMzIxODNhZTA1Y2E3MTQzOTg1YThiNzkwOWQwYWE).
